# Icon for MCP Catalog

For the MCP catalog submission, you'll need to provide an icon (discord-icon.png).

## Requirements
- PNG format
- Recommended size: 512x512 pixels
- Transparent background preferred
- Should represent Discord or bot functionality

## Suggestions
- Use Discord's official logo (check their brand guidelines)
- Create a custom icon combining Discord + AI/bot elements
- Use a free icon from services like:
  - Icons8
  - Flaticon
  - Font Awesome (export as PNG)

Place the icon file as: `assets/discord-icon.png`

Then update `server.yaml` to reference the correct path.
